## Structure

I wanted to take a moment and explain the thought behind the structure of the project. We aimed to put the developer first, giving the avenues of creativity and innovation back within their grasp.

Legesher is modeled in this way: Spoken language --> programming language.

      ARABIC
    /   |   \

Java Python JavaScript

We've set it up in this way because when we add a new language, that developer can program in any language. And as there are far more spoken languages in the world in comparison to programming languages, having spoken language drive the translator and templates puts the developer on top.
