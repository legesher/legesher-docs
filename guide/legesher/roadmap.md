# Roadmap Breakdown

For any project within the Legesher portfolio or any new project that is added, they will all follow this similar guideline and flow.

## Issue Labels

For issues in any repository, they follow the same conventions in terms of the labels that are available. They follow the same style guide for consistency sake across projects.

We group labels by color, according to broad themes. Labels are consistent across repositories, except for a few repository specific concepts. This is for the purpose of making the process of creating new issues and contributing to any repository in the Legesher portfolio easy and consistent.

### Opportunity Labels

## Becoming a Part of the Flock
We love our people and we love empowering them to contribute what they know to push the project forward. We've attempted to make a simple flow for users who want to get more involved, to automate as much of the mundane process as possible.

### If you would like to contribute to the project
### If you would like to view the public roadmap
We use ZenHub for our roadmap and sprint backlog. Unfortunately, the roadmap cannot be visible without being a member of the different repositories. The best way to receive access is to contribute to the project. Outside contributors will receive access as their email is readily available through github. You can also add your [email here](http://eepurl.com/dH0reL) to request access to the roadmap.


## Github Milestones
For managing the Legesher project, sprints are described in GitHub as _milestones_. Each sprint is 2-weeks comprised of around 80 story points (as the project progresses thus number may fluctuate).

### The Sprint Syntax
The sprint syntax follows the syntax: `Sprint [START_DATE]` where the START_DATE follows the date format MM/DD/YY.

### Story Points
Each issue when it is accepted into the current sprint will be given story points. These serve as an estimate of the amount of work that it will take to complete the specific issue. As time progresses, our estimate of how long each issue will take will improve. 1 & 2 story points permit a small change that might include a waiting period, but very little work. 40 story points is a large undertaking and consuming the majority of a contributor's time.

## Epics
Epics are described as larger feature goals that are set for the project. Epics are usually comprised of multiple issues that all feed into the epic's completion. These have their own label `Epic`.

For example, one of our current epics include [Preparing for Open Source Release](https://github.com/legesher/legesher/issues/1). On Github it looks like a normal issue with another label, but within the ZenHub project management tool it contains a snapshot of all the issues that are associated with the epic, current status of all of the issues as well as their story point estimations.

This is what it might look like on ZenHub:

## Pipelines
Within the ZenHub Project Management tool, the issues are then organized into pipelines depending on the status of the issue.

- `New Issues`: When issues are created they first reside here
- `Epic`: Where all the major Epics live  
- `Incubator`: In the icebox - issues/features that are +6 months out  
- `Development Backlog`: Work that is sprint-ready, but not yet accepted and planned into the upcoming Milestone  
- `Sprint Backlog`: Work that has been committed to, and accepted into the upcoming Sprint  
- `In Progress`: For items that are in the current sprint  
- `Review/QA`: For items that are waiting approval  
- `Done`: Issues that have been completed within the specific sprint.  
- `Closed`: When issues are completed they go here  

## Releases
Releases are the larger moments that the public are aware of. When a new version of a software is released, it is included in a "Release". Some may be a patches because a certain bug was found to full on version upgrades.

## Assignees
On each issue an individual or team of people will be assigned when it is added to a Milestone/Sprint. If you are assigned to the issue it is your responsibility to complete the assignment. As always, we are more than willing to help and involve the community as best as you can - even documenting your thought process along the way. If you would like to be assigned to the issue and help solve the issue, please comment on the issue and take the initiative. We love that!! ❤️

  - We have contributor guidelines that are to ensure you're not wasting your time with mundane tasks and additionally so we maintain consistency across the project. When you have contributed to the project, we would like to honor you and thank you for your contribution. When your contribution is accepted, you will receive instructions to receive your gift. 🎁
