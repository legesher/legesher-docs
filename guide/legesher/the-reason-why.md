# The Reason Why

> Okay, but why?

It is absolutely okay if you're asking yourself this question - "But why are we even building this?" In short, we're building Legesher because we can. We're building Legesher to provide new ways for non-native english speakers to understand programming. We're creating a new coworking normalcy for world-wide teams that already tackle enough barriers in their daily collaboration.

For the native English speaker (like myself):

Allow me to paint you a picture.. You're familiar with a `STOP` 🔴 sign right? That red hexagon with 4 white letters `S`, `T`,`O`,`P` that you see at intersections?

When you encounters that STOP sign, you're under a special pretense to do the following:

1. come to a complete stop
2. look both ways for oncoming traffic
3. if clear, proceed with caution to your intended direction.
4. if not, wait until traffic slows

**Consider this**: Imagine one day you wake up, grab your passport, and decide to drive all the way into country for a new experience, a new opportunity. The second you cross the border, the ways of navigation completely change. You still see a 🔴 red hexagon with white letters. **BUT** the white letters aren't `S`, `T`,`O`,`P`. In this country, the instructions on the hexagons are _completely unfamiliar_ to you. With random symbols, you attempt to make your best guess to their meaning and context.

Right now in the world of software development, we're full of `STOP` signs that have the same four letters no matter where you are in the world, no matter what language you natively use. For much of the world, they see that stop sign with letters `completely unfamiliar` to them.

> **But it doesn't have to be this way..**

Language doesn't have to be a barrier. Language can be a bridge. **Legesher** creates this ability for people to learn and develop code in their own native language, without getting stuck trying to understand foreign symbols and slang. That's what we're doing here.
